# ICT513P Spotify Music Track Popularity Analysis (R)

Understanding the elements that affect song rankings is crucial for both music platforms and artists in the fast-paced world of music streaming. The Spotify 1 Million Songs Dataset, provided from Kaggle, has been chosen for this project. This dataset provides a wealth of information on musical tastes, trends in audio features, and the elements that affect a song's popularity. We concentrated on a 10% slice of the data, especially from 2022, including 5.3K data points, to make our research computationally reasonable. We can emphasise the newest musical trends with the help of this subgroup.

In this 2022 analysis, our main objectives are to identify contemporary music track features and trends, investigate the factors affecting track popularity, and determine how various aspects affect user response.

The research will consist of the following: 
- Conduct in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using graphs and statistics.
- Develop predictive models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, and evaluate their performance.
- Implement Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, utilizing the elbow method to identify key elements.
- Explore relationships between variables through biplot analysis.
- Uncover commonalities in the dataset using K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques.
